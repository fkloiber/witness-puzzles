# Todo

## Big Features
* Tracing
* Validation
* Solving
* Local Storage
* Server Storage at some point?

## Smaller Stuff
* Rework grid:
    * [ ] put all info in grid - no separate arrays for start/end points
    * [ ] rework lines: have a `line` property in grid w/ direction?
* [ ] Make constants not an object but separate `const`s so they actually spellcheck
* Add tools to editor
    * [ ] start/end points
    * [ ] lines
    * [x] gaps
* Alternate pillar rendering modes
    * [ ] full-width wrapping <- the current one
    * [ ] full-width tracking (cursor stays in the middle)
    * [ ] half-width tracking (most similar to how it is in the game)

## Bugs
* Firefox... just Firefox
